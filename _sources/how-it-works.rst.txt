How It Works
============

BridgeStan works by wrapping the Stan Model class
generated by the Stan compiler in a simple, C-compatible
interface which exposes the desired functionality.

This allows other languages with C foreign function interfaces
to bind to the compiled "bridged" model and call them. This
is a fairly portable solution, since the subset of the C language
needed is small, and most major platforms employ one of the same
C calling conventions, namely the "cdecl" convention. This
allows the programs, even when they are compiled by different compilers,
to talk to each other in an agreeable way.
